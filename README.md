# UCB CS61B(L) Summer 2025

[Official site](https://cs61bl.org/su25)

## Notable differences from course guidelines

- Using [Summer 2025](https://cs61bl.org/su25/) material:
  the [official](https://cs61bl.org/su25/policies/#auditing-61bl) [policies](https://sp25.datastructur.es/policies/#auditing-cs61b)
  recommend using the [Spring 2021](https://sp21.datastructur.es/) material
  to utilize the public autograder;
  I made the trade-off to follow the latest course work.  
  Note that Homeworks need to be accessed via Gradescope and thus I just supplement with SP21 ones.
- Partially using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/):
  the course [highly recommends](https://cs61bl.org/su25/labs/lab01/#intellij-setup:~:text=We%20highly%20recommend%20using%20IntelliJ.) using [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started.html) [Community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=idea&product=idea-ce)
  with [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) CLI;
I use the Ultimate edition via GitHub Student Developer Pack, utilizing the Git extension, as well as the VS Code editor with the [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) extension (by [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens)).
